                                A cut diet is a structured nutrition plan designed to help individuals reduce body fat while preserving muscle mass. It 
                                typically involves a caloric deficit, meaning you consume fewer calories than your body burns, forcing it to use stored fat 
                                for energy. A well-balanced cut diet prioritizes high-protein intake to maintain muscle, moderate healthy fats for hormone 
                                regulation, and controlled carbohydrates to fuel workouts while preventing excess fat storage. Meal timing, portion control, 
                                and nutrient-dense whole foods play a crucial role in optimizing fat loss. Additionally, strength training and cardiovascular 
                                exercise complement the diet by enhancing metabolism and promoting a lean, defined physique.

                                A maintenance diet is a balanced nutrition plan designed to help individuals sustain their current weight by consuming 
                                the same number of calories that their body burns daily. Unlike a bulk or cut diet, the goal is to maintain a steady energy 
                                balance while supporting overall health, performance, and muscle retention. A well-structured maintenance diet includes a mix 
                                of protein, healthy fats, and carbohydrates to provide sustained energy, aid in muscle recovery, and support metabolic 
                                function. Portion control and nutrient-dense foods help maintain body composition, while flexibility allows for an 
                                enjoyable and sustainable approach to eating. Combined with regular exercise, a maintenance diet ensures long-term health 
                                and fitness without extreme caloric restriction or surplus.

                                A bulk diet is a structured eating plan designed to support muscle growth by consuming a caloric surplus, meaning you eat 
                                more calories than your body burns. The goal is to provide the body with the extra energy and nutrients needed to build 
                                muscle while fueling intense workouts and recovery. A well-balanced bulk diet prioritizes high-protein intake to support 
                                muscle repair, healthy fats for hormone production, and adequate carbohydrates to replenish glycogen stores and sustain 
                                performance. While a clean bulk focuses on whole, nutrient-dense foods to minimize fat gain, a dirty bulk allows for more 
                                calorie-dense, processed foods. Strength training is essential during a bulk to ensure that the extra calories contribute 
                                to muscle growth rather than excessive fat storage.
